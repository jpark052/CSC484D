# CSC484D A1

Questions 1 - 6 are in a1.py.
I have generated result files (.wav) from those questions here as well. <br />

I used Max/MSP for Q7 and Faust for Q8. For advanced question, I picked Q10 (make your own sine function). <br />

Q7 is in q7.maxpat and Q8 is in q8.dsp, and q10 is in Q10.py.
For there questions,, I have took screenshots of them as well for visualization.
